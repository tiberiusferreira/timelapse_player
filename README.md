# Webassembly Timelapse Player

This is a simple video player with custom controls (+5s and +30s) to allow for precise navigation of large videos (4h+).

This is used as part of a kitchen monitoring system in a fraternity house. Previously dirty dishes appeared misteriously out of no where, not anymore!
